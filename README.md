# tiny-game

This is an experiment to see how tiny I can make a working, enjoyable game in C++.  The goal is to be able to fit the final build - including all content - within 1.44mb.  That rules out the use of many off-the-shelf libraries I would normally use for a project like this.  For instance, the Release version of SDL.dll is 859kb - over half of the desired size!

The initial target is Windows using DirectX for graphics/sounds and the WinAPI for windowing, with a later port to Linux and, if we really want to have fun with it, possibly Gamecube and Wii.

There's pretty much nothing here right now, but that will be changing!
